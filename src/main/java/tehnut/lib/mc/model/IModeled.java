     * blockstate location.

     * <ul>
     *     <li>powered=true</li>
     *     <li>color=red</li>
     *     <li>tool=pickaxe</li>

     * For edge-case users: If your sub-items skip over meta, provide either a previously used variant or {@code inventory}
     * and provide an empty default item model.
